# Python-2023

This Python Programming Fundamentals course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of Python programming. The course will cover the basic concepts of Python programming language, including setting up the development environment, data types, loops and functions, object-oriented programming, and modular programming in Python.

In this course, students will learn how to set up a Python development environment on their computers and write basic Python programs using different data types such as strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Students will also learn how to use loops and functions to write more complex programs.

The course will also cover the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to use classes and objects in Python. Students will learn how to create classes and objects, and how to use inheritance and polymorphism to build more complex programs.

Finally, students will learn about modular programming and how to write and use modules and packages in Python. They will learn how to import and export modules, and how to use third-party packages to enhance their Python programs.

Upon completion of this course, students will have a solid foundation in Python programming and will be able to write Python programs with confidence.

> Prerequisites: No prior programming experience is required. However, students should have basic computer skills and familiarity with using a command-line interface.
