    "\n",
    "2. **Visual Debugging:** With features like breakpoints, step-through execution, and variable inspection, VSCode makes it easy to visualize what's happening in your code.\n",

    "3. **Extensibility:** VSCode's debugging capabilities can be extended through various extensions, allowing you to customize your debugging experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Read Error Messages:** Error messages are your friends. They often provide valuable clues about what's going wrong and where to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Print Statements Judiciously:** While VSCode provides advanced debugging tools, sometimes a well-placed `print()` statement can be invaluable for quick checks.\n",
