This isolation helps avoid conflicts between different projects that might rely on different package versions or have conflicting dependencies.\n",

    "- **Package Versions**: Packages can have multiple versions, each with its own set of features, bug fixes, and changes. However, not all projects may be compatible with the latest versions of packages they rely on. Therefore, it's crucial to manage specific package versions to maintain code stability and prevent unexpected behavior."
