In this lecture, we'll briefly touch upon what programming paradigms are and why they matter. You'll learn about the three major paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. By the end of this lecture, you'll have a clear understanding of these paradigms, setting the stage for a deeper exploration into OOP.\n"

Paradigms are not strict rules but rather approaches that offer guidelines on how to tackle different aspects of programming.\n"

    "- Procedural Programming\n",
    "    - Procedural programming is one of the oldest programming paradigms and is based on the concept of procedure calls, also known as routines or functions. This paradigm emphasizes a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem. It organizes code into reusable blocks (functions) and typically follows a top-down approach. Languages like C are known for their procedural style.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "    - Object-oriented programming is centered around the idea of 'objects'. These objects are instances of 'classes', which encapsulate both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) relevant to the object. OOP is built on the principles of inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, allowing for more manageable and scalable code, especially in large software projects. Python, Java, and C++ are examples of languages that support OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functional Programming\n",
    "    - Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions. Functional programming languages like Haskell enforce this paradigm strictly, while languages like Python support functional programming features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical Programming\n",
    "    - Logical programming is a paradigm that is largely based on formal logic. A program is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. The most well-known logical programming language is Prolog. This paradigm is especially suited for programs that involve complex logical queries, such as AI and expert systems."

    "Understanding these paradigms provides a foundation for learning how to use them effectively in your programming projects. Each paradigm has its strengths and is suited for different types of tasks; the choice of which to use often depends on the problem at hand, the requirements of the system, and the preference of the programmer."
