    "In the world of technology and computer science, understanding the origins of programming is essential to grasp the foundations of this ever-evolving field. Programming, at its core, is the art of giving instructions to a computer, enabling it to perform specific tasks and solve complex problems. To truly appreciate the programming languages and tools we have today, it is crucial to explore the early stages of programming and the first programming languages that laid the groundwork for what we now take for granted."
